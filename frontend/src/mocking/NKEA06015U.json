  "Teaching and learning methods": [
    " The course consists of a\ntheoretical part (lectures, exercise classes and discussion of\noriginal articles) and a practical part (laboratory and\ncomputer-based practical sessions). The practical sessions are\ncompulsory. In the latter weeks, a short practical project is\ncarried out, and the course maybe supplemented with\nlectures/practical classes on specialized topics and a visit to the\nMAX IV synchrotron. The practical project will be whenever possible\nindividual, but might have to be carried out in groups if the\nnumber of participants is more than 12. This will be decided by the\ncourse responsible and communicated to the students at the\nbeginning of the course. Even when the project is carried out in\ngroups, the project report must be written (and will be evaluated)\nindividually."

  "raw_description": "crystallography is the main technique by which the three-dimensional structures of molecules are determined. one advantage of crystallography is that similar methods can be used to determine the structure of molecules ranging in size from just a few atoms to the size of ribosomal particle (in the mda range). the aim of this course is to provide the student with fundamental knowledge about the crystallographic methods used to determine the structure of crystalline materials, especially single crystals of bio-macromolecules and small molecules, covering the main aspects of chemical and macromolecular crystallography from crystallization to structure validation. all students will be introduced to both chemical and macromolecular crystallography, but for part of the course the student will be able to choose between a chemical crystallography or macromolecular line, giving additional training specifically in the area of choice. considerable weight is given to the practical part, in which the students will gain experience in structure determination and the use of structural databases, through laboratory and computer-based practical classes and an individual research-based project. the students will be trained in critical reading of original articles and written presentation of own results on structure determination by x-ray crystallography, in particular through writing of a report on their individual project. if you want a general introduction to crystallography, rather than intending to apply what you learn immediately to a project, you may even as an msc student consider the bsc version of the course (crystallography-bsc), but please make sure that your study plan allows you to take a bsc course (you may require special permission). competencies the students must be able to - plan and carry out a small crystallographic project within given constraints of time and resources - analyze standard crystallographic data - evaluate structural models derived from crystallographic data (e.g. from structural databases) - evaluate and discuss the quality of crystallographic data and the derived structural information from literature and scientific databases skills the student must be able to: -  plan and set up crystallization experiments -  process and determine crystallographic space groups from diffraction data -  determine crystallographic structures -  read and critically evaluate original articles and literature in the field -  make use of crystal structure databases for structural comparison and to evaluate structure quality -  undertake, with some guidance, their own small crystallographic project, including design, performance, interpretation of experiments and written communication of used methods, results and discussion of significance knowledge the students must demonstrate knowledge of: - crystallization and diffraction theory  - crystal symmetry  - crystallographic structure determination methods  - structure validation students with a bsc-degree in chemistry, biochemistry and nanoscience have good basis for taking this course. students with related bachelor degrees (for example biology or molecular biomedicine) are recommended to contact the teacher before registering in order to discuss their background knowledge as compared to the level of the course. academic qualifications equivalent to a bsc degree is recommended.",
