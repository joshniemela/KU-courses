    " Teaching will follow three\nmain lines:",
    " - Code-based teaching will involve a visit to field location, in\nwhich students will investigate water, soil, biotic communities\n(flora, fauna microbes etc.) and processes using relevant methods.\nThe samples and observations from the field will subsequently be\nused during laboratory work.",
    " - Concurrently, question-driven teaching will focus on the theory\nof ecological, behavioural, and evolutionary principles and will\nconsist of lectures, seminars, and computer-based exercises.",
    " - Problem-based learning is applied in an individual essay, which\naims at answering ecological questions using empirical data and\nscientific inference."
