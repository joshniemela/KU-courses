  "raw_description": "the main emphasis will be on finite dimensional complex representations of linear groups. topics include: basic definitions and properties of representations, including schur's lemma and maschke's theorem. the representation theory of finite groups, including schur orthogonality. fundamental constructions such as tensor product, dual representations and induced representations. representation theory of compact groups, including the peter-weyl theorem. description of the irreducible representations of s_n, su(2), so(3), and sl(2,c) knowledge: the student will get a knowledge of the most fundamental theorems and constructions in this area. skills: it is the intention that the students get a \"hands on'' familiarity  with the topics so that they can work and study specific representations of specific groups while at the same time learning the abstract framework. competencies: the participants will be able to understand and use representation theory wherever they may encounter it. they will know important examples and will be able to construct  representations of given groups. basic group theory, measure theory, and advanced linear algebra, e.g., from the following courses: algebra 2 (alg2), lebesgueintegralet og målteori (lim) - alternatively analyse 2 (an2) from previous years advanced vector spaces (advec). academic qualifications equivalent to a bsc degree is recommended.",
